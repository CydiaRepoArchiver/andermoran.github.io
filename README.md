# Tweaks
## Nightmare
A jailbreak tweak that enables a nightmode designed for Snapchat. If your eyes are sensitive to light when it's dark, this tweak is for you. Also has other features :)
## CopyScreen (coming soon)
A jailbreak tweak that allows you to copy your screen to clipboard. Useful if you just want to send your screen to someone and don't want to save it to your images.
